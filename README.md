- 👋 Hi, I’m @BrunoLicuadri
- 👀 I’m interested in systems developments, programing, discover new worlds and more, lot more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java. Dont know if I was supposed to start on Java or another code but here I am and here I go.
- 💞️ I’m open for collaboration on everything. There´s always something to learn. In my case, just starting, got whole new world to learn so, a lot to catch on. Scary!
- 📫 For now the best way to reach me is through my e-mail address (blicuadri@gmail.com). I do not expect visitors anytime soon but who knows right?! Im an optmist person.

Thank you for now. I´ll make this better as I go.
Best Regards
